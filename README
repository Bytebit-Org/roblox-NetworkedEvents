# Networked Signals
A TypeScript wrapper for `RemoteEvent`s that provides a type-safe interface for networked signals in a Roblox game.

## Installation
### For roblox-ts
If you already have roblox-ts set up, then just install this package to your project with `npm i @rbxts/networked-signals`.

### For Lua / Luau
This is currently not super simple, but this will be addressed in the future.
